Technical leader skilled in all parts of product design and development, from gathering requirements to architecting, implementing and shipping a scalable production system.

As a lead software engineer at Aver, I'm responsible for delivering high-quality software that aligns with our company's business goals.
While at Aver, I've led a cross-functional team building new products from scratch, solved tough technical problems, helped triple the size of our engineering team, and succesfully drove adoption of modern development practices and agile methods.

I cut my teeth in Silicon Valley but I love living and working in C-Bus.
