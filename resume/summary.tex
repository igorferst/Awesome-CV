I am a product-minded, customer-obsessed engineer who loves helping data scientists and analysts extract insights from complex, large-scale data.

I have deep experience both as an engineer and a technical leader, including founding and exiting a startup that built a data analytics platform for vehicle telematics data (now part of Bridgestone Mobility Solutions). My technical experience spans the entire data stack: designing and building pipelines, ETL, data modeling, and executing analytics/data science projects.

I focus on aligning technical work with business needs, and enjoy engaging directly with data users around requirement gathering and validation, training and upskilling, etc. I thrive in roles that combine leadership, product thinking, and hands-on technical work, especially in high complexity/high ambiguity contexts.
