I am a business-focused technical leader specializing in building software that helps people extract insights from complex data.

I have deep experience working at early and growth stage software companies, including founding and exiting a startup that built a data analytics platform for vehicle telematics data (now part of Bridgestone Mobility Solutions).

I have a diverse skill set spanning software engineering, product management, data science, and leadership. I thrive in roles that combine leadership, product thinking, and hands-on technical work, especially in high complexity/high ambiguity contexts.
