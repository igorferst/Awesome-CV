Technical leader skilled in all parts of software design and development, from gathering requirements to architecting, implementing and shipping a scalable production system.
I'm looking for a high-impact, high-leverage role as a technical and/or product leader.

As a lead software engineer at Aver, I was responsible for delivering high-quality software that aligns with our company's business goals.
While at Aver, I led cross-functional teams building new products from scratch, solved difficult and high-impact technical problems, helped triple the size of the engineering team, and successfully drove adoption of modern development practices and agile methods.

I cut my teeth in Silicon Valley but I love living and working in Columbus.
