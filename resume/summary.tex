I'm an experienced engineer who loves helping data scientists and analysts extract insights from complex, large-scale data. I've spent 13 years supporting technical data needs across a variety of domains (insurance, healthcare, capital markets, and others) as a data engineer, software engineer, and entrepreneur.

I have deep experience across the entire data stack: designing and building pipelines, ETL, data modeling, and executing analytics/data science projects. I focus on aligning technical work with business needs, and enjoy engaging directly with data users around requirement gathering and validation, training and upskilling, etc.
