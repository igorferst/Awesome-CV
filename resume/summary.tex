I am a veteran startup engineer specializing in data, with deep experience in fast-paced, large-scale, high-complexity environments. I've architected, built and scaled data platforms and data products at multiple early and growth-stage companies, most notably as the co-founder and CTO of a startup building an analytics platform for vehicle telematics data (Mobikit, acquired by Bridgestone).

Though a data engineer by trade, I have experience with all parts of the data stack: data engineering, data science, ML and MLOps, analytics and BI. I thrive in roles that combine hands-on execution and strategic thinking, and enjoy working closely with stakeholders and data practitioners to maximize their data's business value.
