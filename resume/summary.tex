Product-minded data and software engineer with 10+ years of experience architecting and scaling data platforms in fast-paced, high-ambiguity, high-complexity environments. Deep experience with early-stage teams and products, most notably as the co-founder and CTO of a startup building an analytics platform for vehicle telematics data (Mobikit, acquired by Bridgestone).

Iâ€™ve built analytics infrastructure from scratch, led cross-functional teams, and translated messy and large-scale real-world data into business-critical insights. I thrive at the intersection of hands-on engineering, data architecture, and user-driven product strategy.
