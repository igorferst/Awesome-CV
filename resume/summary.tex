I'm a product-minded, customer-obsessed engineer and entrepreneur. I have deep experience at early and growth stage companies, most notably as the co‐founder and CTO of a startup building an analytics platform for vehicle telematics data (Mobikit, acquired by Bridgestone).

I've built products from scratch, led cross-functional teams, and built solutions for global enterprises. I thrive in roles that combine strategy, product thinking, and hands‐on technical work, especially in high complexity/high ambiguity environments.
